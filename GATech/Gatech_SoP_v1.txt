career 
objective 
My 
plan 
after 
graduation 
with 
a 
doctoral 
degree 
is 
that 
I 
will 
look 
for 
a 
research 
or 
post-doc 
position 
that 
is 
related 
to 
the 
eld 
of 
my 
dissertation 
in 
order 
to 
continue 
to 
accumulate 
research 
knowledge 
and 
experience. 
However, 
my 
eventual 
professional 
goal 
is 
a 
university 
professor 
in 
the 
eld 
and 
plan 
to 
lead 
my 
own 
research 
laboratory. 
Research 
experience 
gained 
during 
the 
PhD 
study 
and 
accumulated 
during 
my 
tenure 
will 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
attracting 
funds 
and 
students 
into 
my 
lab. 


0.2 
background 
During 
my 
undergraduate 
study, 
in 
addition 
to 
a 
number 
of 
Electrical 
Engineering 
subjects, 
I 
studied 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
mathematical 
subjects 
including 
four 
Calculus 
courses, 
a 
course 
on 
Probability, 
and 
another 
on 
Linear 
Algebra 
and 
Complex 
Numbers, 
all 
of 
which 
are 
basic 
principles 
of 
computer 
science
. 
Moreover, 
I 
passed 
two 
courses 
on 
computer 
programming, 
data 
structures 
and 
algorithms, 
which 
are 
the 
crucial 
knowledge 
of 
a 
successful 
computer 
scientist. 
For 
the 
Master's 
degree 
study, 
I 
passed 
eight 
credited 
computer 
science 
graduate 
courses. 
I 
studied 
two 
theoretical 
courses, 
namely 
Theory 
of 
Computation 
and 
Computer 
Algorithms, 
ve 
systems 
courses 
namely 
Information 
Systems 
Architecture, 
Distributed 
Systems, 
Advanced 
Topics 
on 
Computer 
Networks 
(Multimedia, 
Wireless 
and 
Adhoc 
Networks)
, 
Embedded 
Systems, 
and 
Database 
Management 
Systems, 
and 
one 
Articial 
Intelligence 
course. 
Moreover, 
I 
passed 
two 
non-credit 
courses 
-namely 
Computer 
Security 
and 
Special 
Topics 
on 
Distributed 
Systems 
(Service 
Computing). 
In 
sum, 
I 
earn 
a 
solid 
foundation 
in 
computer 
science 
as 
a 
result 
of 
my 
undergraduate 
and 
graduate 
study. 


In 
addition, 
I 
gain 
valuable 
research 
experience 
during 
my 
Master's 
degree 
study 
and 
I 
would 
like 
to 
explain 
three 
principal 
research 
skills 
in 
this 
letter. 
First, 
I 
learn 
the 
critical 
reading 
skills. 
As 
an 
important 
part 
of 
research 
methodology 
in 
computer 
science, 
literature 
reviewing 
is 
an 
everyday 
activity 
of 
graduate 
students. 
Researchers 
study 
research 
papers 
not 
only 
to 
understand 
the 
overall 
concepts 
but 
also 
to 
critique 
them, 
nd 
weak 
points 
and 
discover 
hidden 
assumptions. 
With 
this 
critical 
reading, 
I 
can 
nd 
a 
research 
opportunity 
hidden 
in 
a 
research 
paper 
and 
can 
think 
of 
\what 
to 
do 
next” 
instead 
of 
just 
\this 
work 
is 
interesting". 
Second, 
I 
learn 
how 
to 
give 
an 
intelligible 
academic 
presentation. 
At 
the 
UbiNet 
lab 
under 
the 
supervision 
of 
Assistant 
Professor 
Dr. 
Chalermek 
Intanagonwiwat, 
each 
lab 
member 
took 
turns 
giving 
one 
progress 
presentation 
reporting 
the 
progress 
toward 
the 
thesis 
work 
and 
one 
paper 
presentation 
illustrating 
the 
ideas 
and 
results 
of 
a 
research 
paper 
of 
interest. 
Through 
this 
regular 
lab 
activity, 
I 
learned 
to 
select 
an 
interesting 
paper 
published 
in 
a 
well-known 
conference 
or 
journal 
publisher, 
to 
extract 
outstanding 
points 
in 
the 
paper 
and 
to 
present 
them 
in 
a 
way 
that 
made 
it 
easier 
for 
the 
audience 
to 
understand. 
Third, 
after 
completing 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
literature 
review 
and 
implementation 
work, 
I 
need 
to 
publish 
a 
paper 
in 
order 
to 
organize 
my 
ideas 
into 
a 
standard 
format, 
to 
distribute 
my 
work 
for 
other 
researchers 
to 
study 
and 
to 
welcome 
feedbacks 
and 
comments 
from 
reviewers 
which 
help 
strengthen 
my 
work. 
According 
to 
my 
advisor, 
a 
high-quality 
paper 
in 
computer 
science 
should 
not 
only 
allow 
the 
readers 
to 
understand 
the 
overall 
picture 
of 
the 
work, 
but 
also 
enable 
them 
to 
implement 
it 
into 
the 
code 
themselves. 
Therefore, 
I 
learn 
to 
explain 
the 
data 
structures, 
algorithms, 
and 
communication 
packets 
so 
clearly 
that 
one 
could 
use 
all 
this 
information 
for 
further 
experimentation. 
In 
sum, 
I 
earn 
research 
experience 
and 
skills 
not 
through 
lectures 
or 
workshops 
but 
by 
application 
and 
repetition 
throughout 
the 
years 
of 
the 
Master's 
degree 
study. 


Up 
to 
now, 
I 
have 
published 
three 
academic 
publications, 
two 
of 
which 
are 
in 
international 
conferences’ 
proceedings 
and 
the 
other 
is 
in 
an 
ACM 
journal. 
First, 
\Energy-Ecient 
Gradient 
Time 
Synchronization 
for 
Wireless 
Sensor 
Networks” 
was 
published 
in 
the 
proceedings 
of 
the 
Second 
International 
Conference 
on 
Computational 
Intelligence, 
Communication 
Systems 
and 
Networks 
or 
CICSyN. 
In 
the 
paper, 
we 
designed 
an 
extended 
version 
of 
gradient 
time 
synchronization 
protocols 
that 
was 
more 
time-accurate 
and 
energy-ecient, 
while 
maintaining 
a 
\gradient” 
property. 
With 
the 
gradient 
property, 
geographically 
adjacent 
nodes 
are 
able 
to 
maintain 
minimal 
synchronization 
errors. 
Second, 
\Desynchronization 
with 
an 
articial 
force 
eld 
for 
wireless 
networks” 
was 
published 
in 
ACM 
SIGCOMM's 
Computer 
Communication 
Review. 
The 
desynchronization 
problem 
was 
analogous 
to 
a 
resource 
allocation 
problem 
in 
which 
nodes 
cooperated 
to 
take 
turns 
accessing 
to 
the 
same 
resource. 
In 
this 
paper, 
we 
provided 
a 
prove 
of 
convexity 
of 
this 
problem. 
Additionally, 
we 
designed 
a 
desynchronization 
protocol, 
inspired 
by 
electromagnetic 
force

eld, 
that 
performed 
in 
a 
distributed 
manner, 
better 
scaled 
with 
network 
sizes 
and 
densities 
and 
produced 
less 
desynchronization 
errors. 
The 
rst 
two 
papers 
were 
my 
work 
under 
the 
supervision 
of 
Assistant 
Professor 
Dr. 
Chalermek 
Intanagonwiwat. 
Third, 
in 
2013, 
I 
had 
a 
change 
to 
work 
on 
a 
research 
project 
with 
Associate 
Professor 
Dr. 
Teerasit 
Kasetkasem 
of 
Kasetsart 
University. 
In 
this 
project, 
we 
used 
a 
signal 
processing 
technique 
to 
track 
a 
moving 
object 
in 
a 
eld 
given 
binary 
sensor 
observations. 
In 
this 
paper, 
I 
was 
fully 
responsible 
for 
the 
manuscript 
preparation 
and 
partly 
for 
experimental 
simulation. 
Finally, 
the 
paper 
titled 
\A 
Moving 
Object 
Tracking 
Algorithm 
Using 
Support 
Vector 
Machines 
in 
Binary 
Sensor 
Networks", 
was 
nally 
published 
in 
the 
proceedings 
of 
The 
13th 
International 
Symposium 
on 
Communications 
and 
Information 
Technologies. 


I 
also 
have 
seven-year 
professional 
experience 
working 
at 
Aeronautical 
Radio 
of 
Thailand 
or 
Aerothai, 
a 
state 
enterprise 
under 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Transport, 
Thailand. 
One 
of 
Aerothai's 
principal 
missions 
is 
to 
provide 
safe 
and 
ecient 
air 
navigation 
services 
or 
air 
trac 
control 
within 
Thailand's 
airspace. 
Specically, 
the 
department 
of 
air 
trac 
data 
systems 
engineering 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
provision 
and 
administration 
of 
data 
systems 
that 
support 
air 
trac 
controllers’ 
operations. 
At 
the 
department, 
my 
colleagues 
and 
I 
design, 
congure, 
and 
implement 
those 
systems 
by 
taking 
advantage 
of 
enterprise-graded 
computing 
system 
products, 
mostly 
of 
the 
USA, 
such 
as 
HP 
and 
Dell 
servers, 
Oracle 
and 
Microsoft 
databases, 
Cisco 
network 
equipment, 
and 
VMWare's 
virtualization 
technology, 
etc. 
One 
of 
the 
interesting 
aeronautical 
applications 
that 
runs 
on 
these 
infrastructures 
is 
the 
ight 
scheduling 
service, 
named 
Bay 
of 
Bengal 
Cooperative 
Air 
Trac 
Flow 
Management 
System 
or 
BOBCAT. 
BOBCAT 
manages 
the 
air 
trac 
over 
the 
Bay 
of 
Bengal, 
which 
has 
the 
security 
constraints. 
Approximately 
60 
ights 
per 
day 
request 
to 
y 
through 
this 
narrow 
airspace; 
therefore, 
International 
Civil 
Aviation 
Organization 
or 
ICAO 
demands 
that 
the 
airspace 
be 
managed 
by 
Aerothai, 
after 
the 
systems 
competition 
with 
other 
organizations. 
Nowadays, 
BOBCAT 
smoothly 
serves 
tens 
of 
airline 
customers 
requesting 
air 
space 
slots 
over 
the 
area 
every 
day 
thanks 
to 
Aerothai's 
eective 
software 
systems 
and 
responsive 
operational 
procedures. 
Therefore, 
I 
have 
witnessed 
how 
these 
innovative 
products 
help 
enhance 
reliability 
and 
eciency 
of 
air 
trac 
data 
systems. 
This 
hand-on 
experience 
has 
provided 
me 
with 
practical 
aspects 
of 
enterprise 
information 
systems 
with 
the 
safety-critical 
applications, 
and 
motivates 
me 
to 
study 
more 
deeply 
and 
broadly 
in 
computer 
science, 
a 
core 
foundation 
of 
computer-related 
products 
and 
services. 


0.3 
Statement 
of 
Purpose 
This 
statement 
of 
purpose 
is 
intended 
for 
use 
with 
my 
application 
to 
the 
Doctor 
of 
Philosophy 
graduate 
program 
at 
the 
School 
of 
Computer 
Science, 
Georgia 
Institute 
of 
Technology. 
In 
this 
document, 
I 
explain 
my 
motivation 
for 
the 
PhD 
study, 
my 
interest 
in 
Georgia 
Tech's 
teaching 
and 
research 
and 
my 
future 
plans 
after 
Ph.D. 
graduation. 
After 
nishing 
reading 
this 
statement 
of 
purpose, 
the 
committee 
will 
learn 
why 
I 
am 
qualied 
to 
be 
an 
excellent 
student 
of 
the 
program, 
what 
motivates 
me 
to 
pursue 
the 
doctoral 
degree 
at 
Georgia 
Tech 
and 
why 
it 
is 
so 
important 
for 
my 
future 
profession 
that 
I 
earn 
this 
degree. 


I 
determine 
to 
advance 
my 
study 
to 
a 
PhD 
in 
the 
US 
because 
of 
the 
following 
three 
main 
reasons. 
First 
and 
most 
importantly, 
I 
want 
to 
be 
a 
professional 
researcher 
in 
computer 
science 
in 
the 
future, 
either 
in 
an 
academic 
institution 
or 
in 
a 
research 
laboratory 
and 
a 
doctoral 
degree 
is 
an 
important 
precursor 
to 
the 
research 
profession. 
Second, 
I 
agree 
with 
Matt 
Welsh, 
previously 
a 
professor 
of 
Computer 
Science 
at 
Harvard 
University, 
about 
a 
PhD 
study. 
He 
suggests 
that 
\You 
get 
an 
intense 
exposure 
to 
every 
subeld 
of 
Computer 
Science, 
and 
have 
to 
become 
the 
leading 
world's 
expert 
in 
the 
area 
of 
your 
dissertation 
work.” 
For 
example, 
during 
my 
PhD 
study, 
I 
will 
have 
an 
opportunity 
to 
get 
exposed 
to 
a 
variety 
of 
academic 
subjects 
and 
research 
projects 
in 
computer 
science, 
such 
as 
Articial 
Intelligence, 
Computer 
Graphics, 
Robotics, 
Databases, 
Systems, 
Software 
Engineering, 
and 
Computational 
Science, 
etc., 
all 
of 
which 
will 
considerably 
expand 
my 
intellectual 
horizons 
in 
computer 
science. 
Moreover, 
the 
PhD 
study 
will 
train 
me 
to 
be 
an 
expert 
in 
the 
eld 
of 
my 
dissertation 
through 
the 
educational 
systems 
and 
processes, 
and 
through 
my 
assiduous 
and 
persevering 
eorts. 
Third, 
I 
am 
conscious 
that 
studying 
at 
a 
PhD 
level 
requires 
an 
academically 
vibrant 
environment 
which 
includes 
surroundings 
with 
brilliant 
students 
and 
faculty 
members, 
as 
well 
as 
accessible 
academic 
conferences 
and 
seminars. 
In 
my 
opinion, 
all 
of 
these 
are 
prevalent 
in 
the 
US 
educational 
systems 
and 
universities. 


I 
aspire 
to 
become 
a 
PhD 
student 
at 
the 
School 
of 
Computer 
Science, 
Georgia 
Institute 
of 
Technology, 
a 
prestigious 
university 
in 
the 
US, 
because 
I 
am 
particularly 
interested 
in 
its 
teaching 
and 
research.

Georgia 
Institute 
of 
Technology 


begin 
with 
the 
teaching, 
the 
course 
\Computer 
Networks” 
is 
basically 
of 
my 
interest. 
In 
this 
course, 
I 
will 
have 
a 
chance 
to 
sharpen 
my 
understanding 
of 
computer 
networks, 
following 
a 
classical 
computer 
network 
textbook 
\Computer 
Networking: 
A 
Top-Down 
Approach". 
I 
studied 
this 
textbook 
both 
for 
a 
graduate 
course 
and 
by 
myself, 
and 
found 
that 
its 
top-down 
approach 
allowed 
me 
to 
zoom 
from 
the 
big 
picture 
of 
the 
Internet's 
applications 
to 
individual 
protocols 
of 
each 
layer 
in 
the 
protocol 
stack. 
Second, 
\Software 
Dened 
Networking” 
is 
an 
interesting 
seminar 
that 
introduces 
software 
dened 
networking 
that 
allows 
network 
researchers 
or 
administrators 
to 
program 
the 
networks. 
It 
centralizes 
control 
and 
conguration 
into 
the 
control 
plane 
while 
letting 
the 
data 
plane 
forward 
the 
communication 
packets. 
Third, 
the 
project-based 
\Advanced 
Internet 
Application 
Development” 
course 
requires 
students 
to 
aggregate 
the 
knowledge 
of 
operating 
systems, 
database 
management, 
computer 
networks, 
and 
distributed 
systems 
so 
that 
they 
can 
use 
this 
body 
of 
knowledge 
to 
develop 
potential 
and 
high-performance 
Internet 
applications. 


The 
following 
are 
Georgia 
Tech's 
faculty 
whose 
research 
projects 
interest 
and 
excite 
me. 
First, 
Associat
e 
Professor 
Nick 
Feamster 
is 
a 
notable 
and 
active 
researcher 
in 
computer 
networks. 
His 
publications 
continuously 
appear 
on 
conference 
and 
journal 
articles 
of 
ACM 
SIGCOMM, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
dominant 
computer 
network 
research 
communities. 
For 
example, 
\Measuring 
and 
Mitigating 
Web 
Performance 
Bottlenecks 
in 
Broadband 
Access 
Networks” 
is 
an 
interesting 
Internet 
measurement 
paper 
that 
tries 
to 
solve 
an 
everyday 
problem 
of 
web 
latency 
from 
home 
users’ 
perspective. 
For 
example, 
when 
I 
am 
opening 
the 
web 
page 
www.gatech.edu 
and 
facing 
an 
annoying 
latency, 
I 
tend 
to 
blame 
either 
the 
slow 
web 
server 
or 
my 
poor 
home 
Internet 
connection. 
However, 
this 
paper 
takes 
advantage 
of 
a 
measurement 
tool 
to 
nd 
the 
\root 
cause” 
of 
the 
latency; 
then, 
it 
proposes 
a 
simple 
solution 
of 
\home 
caching". 
Its 
simple 
concept 
is 
to 
pre-fetch 
content 
and 
information 
that 
cause 
the 
latency; 
as 
a 
result, 
a 
home 
user 
experiences 
faster 
web 
performance 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
trivial 
cache 
storage. 
His 
research 
style 
is 
a 
paragon 
of 
solving 
a 
practical 
problem 
with 
a 
simple 
solution.

interests 
span 
cloud, 
mobile, 
and 
distributed 
computing. 
Tens 
of 
her 
publications 
appear 
on 
top 
conference 
and 
journal 
articles 
of 
the 
research 
areas 
every 
year. 
For 
example, 
her 
publication 
\Enhanced 
Monitoring-as-a-Service 
for 
Eective 
Cloud 
Management” 
introduce
s 
monitor-as-a-service 
in 
the 
cloud 
with 
the 
features 
of 
state 
monitoring, 
self-adjustment, 
and 
monitoring 
consolidation. 
One 
of 
its 
main 
goals 
is 
to 
reduce 
the 
monitoring 
cost. 
From 
my 
perspective 
as 
a 
systems 
engineer 
maintaining 
and 
monitoring 
aeronautical 
data 
sytems, 
this 
issue 
is 
important 
because 
while 
I 
want 
my 
monitoring 
systems 
to 
be 
as 
responsive 
to 
a 
problem 
or 
anomaly 
as 
possible, 
I 
need 
to 
prevent 
them 
from 
using 
a 
lot 
of 
my 
production 
systems 
resources, 
such 
as 
bandwidth 
of 
the 
networks, 
and 
memory 
and 
CPU 
of 
the 
servers. 
With 
the 
supposedly 
large 
scale 
of 
cloud 
computing, 
a 
monitoring 
with 
all 
these 
features 
is 
preferable 
and 
needs 
extensive 
attention 
from 
cloud 
computing 
research. 


Third, 
Professor 
Dr. 
Calton 
Pu's 
interesting 
Elba 
research 
project 
tackles 
a 
problem 
of 
adaptive 
enterprise 
computing 
which 
answers 
a 
question 
of 
how 
to 
evaluate 
and 
tune 
a 
large-scaled 
production 
enterprise 
systems 
\on-the-y". 
A 
project 
paper 
\Detecting 
Transient 
Bottlenecks 
in 
n-Tier 
Applications 
through 
Fine-Grained 
Analysis” 
proposes 
a 
ne-grained 
technique 
to 
analyze 
transient 
bottlenecks 
in 
an 
n-tier 
systems. 
Transient 
bottlenecks 
occur 
in 
such 
a 
short 
time 
that 
existing 
monitoring 
tools 
with 
a 
granularity 
of 
seconds 
or 
minutes 
fail 
to 
capture 
them. 
In 
my 
opinion, 
my 
professional 
experience 
with 
practical 
enterprise 
systems 
with 
safety-critical 
applications 
can 
contribute 
to 
this 
and 
other 
related 
projects 
of 
Professor 
Dr. 
Calton 
Pu. 
In 
sum, 
because 
Georgia 
Tech's 
teaching 
and 
research 
match 
my 
academic 
interest 
and 
goals, 
the 
School 
of 
Computer 
ScienceGeorgia 
Institute 
of 
Technology 
will 
be 
a 
perfect 
place 
for 
my 
PhD 
study 
until 
my 
graduation 
day. 


My 
plan 
after 
graduation 
with 
a 
doctoral 
degree 
is 
that 
I 
will 
look 
for 
a 
research 
or 
post-doc 
position 
that 
is 
related 
to 
the 
eld 
of 
my 
dissertation 
in 
order 
to 
continue 
to 
accumulate 
research 
knowledge 
and 
experience. 
However, 
my 
eventual 
professional 
goal 
is 
a 
university 
professor 
in 
the 
eld 
and 
plan 
to 
lead 
my 
own 
research 
laboratory. 
Research 
experience 
gained 
during 
the 
PhD 
study 
and 
accumulated 
during 
my 
tenure 
will 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
attracting 
funds 
and 
students 
into 
my 
lab. 


I 
would 
like 
to 
express 
my 
appreciation 
to 
the 
graduate 
admission 
committee 
of 
Georgia 
Institute 
of 
Technology 
for 
taking 
my 
personal 
statement 
along 
with 
other 
application 
materials 
into 
consideration. 
I 
hope 
that 
the 
committee 
will 
be 
convinced 
that 
my 
educational 
background, 
academic 
and 
professional 
experience, 
and 
research 
ambition 
and 
motivation 
are 
the 
evidences 
sucient 
to 
suggest 
that 
I 
will 
be 
an 
excellent 
student 
of 
the 
PhD 
program 
and 
a 
competent 
researcher 
in 
computer 
science.
