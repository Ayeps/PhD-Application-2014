		\item[Publication Name]The 13th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies
		\item[Publication Date]\textit{To appear}
		\item[Abstract]{\sl \small Wireless sensor technologies have enabled us to deploy such small sensors to monitor an area of interest. Object tracking is one of the most attractive applications to be implemented with wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, many solutions are struggled with energy-draining global positioning system (GPS), poorly-performed trilateration for indoor usage, and impractical, complex algorithms to be implemented in sensor nodes. This paper proposes a moving object tracking algorithm using support vector machines (MOT-SVM). The MOT-SVM takes advantage of light-weighted directional binary sensor networks, and state-of-the-art signal processing algorithms, namely the support vector machines and particle filters. We compare our proposed algorithm with the Aslam's work [1] through the simulation. We examine our algorithms for various movement scenarios such as the linear, random and the 8-model trajectories, and the scenarios in which observing sensors make observation errors.}

		\item[Authors]Supasate Choochaisri, Kittipat Apicharttrisorn, Kittiporn Korprasertthaworn, Pongpakdi Taechalertpaisarn and  Chalermek Intanagonwiwat
		\item[Publication Name]SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review
		\item[Publication Date]March 2012 
		\item[Abstract]{\sl \small Desynchronization is useful for scheduling nodes to perform tasks at different time. This property is desirable for resource sharing, TDMA scheduling, and collision avoiding. Inspired by robotic circular formation, we propose DWARF (Desynchronization With an ARtificial Force field), a novel technique for desynchronization in wireless networks. Each neighboring node has artificial forces to repel other nodes to perform tasks at different time phases. Nodes with closer time phases have stronger forces to repel each other in the time domain. Each node adjusts its time phase proportionally to its received forces. Once the received forces are balanced, nodes are desynchronized. We evaluate our implementation of DWARF on TOSSIM, a simulator for wireless sensor networks. The simulation results indicate that DWARF incurs significantly lower desynchronization error and scales much better than existing approaches.}

		\begin{description}\itemsep -2pt 
		\item[Authors]Kittipat Apicharttrisorn, Supasate Choochaisri and Chalermek Intanagonwiwat
		\item[Publication Name]2010 Second International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks (CICSyN)
		\item[Publication Date]July 2010
		\item[Abstract]{\sl \small Wireless sensor network (WSN) applications usually demand a time-synchronization protocol for node coordination and data interpretation. In this paper, we propose an Energy-Efficient Gradient Time Synchronization Protocol (EGTSP) for Wireless Sensor Networks. In contrast to FTSP, a state-of-the-art synchronization protocol for WSNs, EGTSP is a completely localized algorithm that achieves a global time consensus and gradient time property using effective drift compensation and incremental averaging estimation. In contrast with GTSP, a gradient-based fixed-rated time synchronization protocol, our protocol provides adaptive beaconing for applications to optimize energy savings by selecting appropriate message-broadcast periods. The protocol is implemented and evaluated on multi-hop networks that consist of Telosb motes running TinyOS. The experimental results indicate that our protocol achieves a network-wide global notion of time, attains small synchronization errors, and utilizes energy efficiently.}
